# Dragon Farm Design System

Welcome to the Dragon Farm Design System! This system is built around the mystical **Ocean Dragon Color Palette**, inspired by the depths of the ocean and the ancient scales of dragons.

## üé® Color Philosophy

Our color palette tells the story of dragons dwelling in ocean depths:

- **Emerald** (#28dd86) - The vibrant life force of growing dragons
- **Teal** (#109ca7) - The wisdom of ancient ocean currents
- **Navy** (#0c366f) - The mysterious depths where dragons rest
- **Deep Purple** (#23024d) - The magical essence of dragon power
- **Dark Purple** (#34073a) - The ancient shadows of forgotten legends

## üêâ Design Principles

### 1. Mystical Hierarchy

Use darker purples for the most important content, with emerald for actions that bring life and growth.

### 2. Ocean-Inspired Flow

Colors should flow like ocean currents - from the bright emerald surfaces down to the deep purple depths.

### 3. Dragon Scale Patterns

Interface elements should feel as natural and organic as dragon scales, with subtle gradients and smooth transitions.

### 4. Accessibility First

All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements, ensuring every user can access the magic.

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

### Primary Actions

- Use **Dragon Navy** (#0c366f) for main navigation and primary buttons
- Use **Dragon Emerald** (#28dd86) for success states and call-to-action buttons

### Secondary Elements

- Use **Dragon Teal** (#109ca7) for secondary actions and informational content
- Use standard variants for neutral actions

### Text and Content

- Use **Deep Purple** (#23024d) for headings and important text
- Use **Navy** for body text and secondary content
- Use **Dark Purple** (#34073a) for dark themes and premium content

### States and Feedback

- **Emerald**: Success, completion, positive feedback
- **Teal**: Information, progress, neutral states
- **Navy**: Focus, selection, primary states
- **Purple**: Premium features, magical elements

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

The color system is implemented through:

1. **CSS Custom Properties** - Semantic color variables in `index.css`
2. **Tailwind Classes** - Direct color utilities (`bg-dragon-emerald`, etc.)
3. **Component Variants** - Pre-configured component styles
4. **Theme Support** - Light and dark theme variations

## üì± Components

All components are designed to work harmoniously with the Ocean Dragon palette:

- **Buttons** - Dragon-themed variants for different actions
- **Cards** - Subtle borders and hover effects using palette colors
- **Forms** - Consistent focus states and validation colors
- **Navigation** - Depth and hierarchy through color progression
